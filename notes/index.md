My name is Tiger Yuhao Huang.

Welcome to my [digital garden](digital-garden.md)!

I am currently working as a python backend engineer at
[Saltus](https://www.saltus.co.uk/)!

My biggest passions are
software engineering,
[home cooking](cooking.md),
boardgames, 
coffee roasting and brewing,
reading,
[eating out](recommendations.md),
...

My dream is to open a cafe called "Tou", it sells Man Tou (Chinese steamed bun
with no filling), black filter coffee, latte using hand roasted coffee beans.

# Cheatsheet Software Engineering

## Give Consistent Code Review

- add `doc string` if there is anything unclear
- understand **all** code and tests added/modified
- handle network and other errors gracefully?
- read and test my comments carefully
- add ideas about incremental improvements

## Write Consistent Documentations and Git Commit Message

- present tense
- one concise line 

## Behavioral - Personal growth

- Take it easy!
- There is No Such Thing as Over Communication!
- Look for opportunity for incremental improvement
- Read documentation/manual/user’s guide before using a new tool/cli
    - this implies prefer using tool with good doc e.g. `fish` instead `bash`
- Be more curious about how things work internally
- Be prepared because I am bad at ac-hoc talk and thinking
    - ask for agenda for meetings so that I can be prepared
- Validate assumptions earlier

## Documentations - Building structures with natural language

- Write non-code How To, repeatable steps for public or personal, e.g.
    - How-To deploy UAT
    - How-To add a graphql endpoint 
- Write code comments, documentations before implementation 
    - remember the 4 types of documentation, Tutorial, How-To Step by Step Guides,
      Explanation, Reference
    - George Orwell's 12 points

## Design - Writing good code

- Design it twice
    - write down two designs, each with pros and cons, then perhaps there will
      appear a third design with combined pros and less cons
- Architect great design rather than just working codes, then writing comments
  should be fun since that’s how you identify the best design
- reduce complexity by adding or removing abstraction

## Meaning Of Life

I believe that the meaning of life is to be alive.

I once thought the meaning of life is to enjoy every moment of life, but I don't think it is true any more because there were good days and bad days so it wasn't always possible to enjoy it.

But being alive (please do try your best) let you experience life in both its beauty and the ugly. Life is your unique experience with the world and every choices you made.

Others also believe in this idea.

> The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.
> ---- Alan Wilson Watts
