# About These Notes

## TL;DR

This websites contains work in progress/developing personal notes.

- Every page is always work in progress
- Every page is by default public on day 1, similar to the idea [open source by default](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/08/21/OSS-by-Default-Docs/)

## Why do I write these notes?

- practise writing
- build the habit of writing
- record my random thoughts

George Orwell gives the following [four reasons](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/) on why every writer writes.

**Sheer Egoism**

This is very true for me, when I was in primary school, Chinese and English
are my worst subjects. I might just want to show that I can write and I can
speak English.

**Aesthetic Enthusiasm**

Good writings are just beautiful.

**Historical Impulse**

These notes record my random ideas, for whatever reason, my brain is running
most of the time, new ideas constantly pop up in my head, just want to write
them down.

**Political Purpose**

> using the word ‘political’ in the widest possible sense. Desire to push the
> world in a certain direction, to alter other people’s idea of the kind of
> society that they should strive after. Once again, no book is genuinely free
> from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with
> politics is itself a political attitude. -- George Orwell

## Site Infrastructure

These html pages are all markdown files in [Github Repository](https://github.com/ynotstartups/ynotstartups.github.io). By using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), `mkdocs gh-deploy` publishes to Github page.

I value the simplicity of this setup.

Because I have been writing code in Vim for years and I recently got used to
writing documentations in Vim, so writing these notes in Vim feels easy and
natural to me. I don't need any mental transition to write notes.
