<p>Typically,</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Key is used to encrypt messages.</li>
<li>Private Key is used to decrypt messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, if some text is encrypted with private key, only public
key can decrypted it.</p>
<p>If some text is encrypted with public key, only private key can
decrypted it.</p>
<p>For example, HTTPS handshake is basically, I get the Public Key of a
website, generate a random password, encrypt it with Public Key and then
send it to the website server and then website server uses Private Key
to decrypt the password, so this password is shared. And further
communication is encrypted using that shared password.</p>
<p>But really, public key isnâ€™t just for encryption nor private for
decryption, the otherway around works too, private key can be used for
encryption and public key for decryption.</p>
<p>One example that uses private key for encryption is digital
signature, take some text/file, create a digest of test/file, encrypt
the digest with private key and send the encrypted digest together with
the text/file. Then if the public key successfully decrypt the encrypted
digest and the digest matches then we know the test/file is the
original, because the only key that can encrypt something that can be
decrypt with public key is the private key.</p>
<p>The only reason public and private keys are not interchangeable is
because you can recreate the public key from private key.</p>
