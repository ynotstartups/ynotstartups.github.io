<li>Every page is always work in progress</li>
<li>Every page is by default public on day 1, similar to the idea <a

<ul>
<li>practise writing</li>
<li>build the habit of writing</li>
<li>record my random thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>George Orwell gives the following <a
href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/">four
reasons</a> on why every writer writes.</p>
<p><strong>Sheer Egoism</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish. After the age
of about thirty they abandon individual ambition – in many cases,
indeed, they almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all – and
live chiefly for others, or are simply smothered under drudgery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very true for me, when I was in primary school, Chinese and
English are my worst subjects. I might just want to show that I can
write and I can speak English.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic Enthusiasm</strong></p>
<p>Good writings are just beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Impulse</strong></p>
<p>These notes record my random ideas, for whatever reason, my brain is
running most of the time, new ideas constantly pop up in my head, just
want to write them down.</p>
<p><strong>Political Purpose</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>using the word ‘political’ in the widest possible sense. Desire to
push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people’s idea of
the kind of society that they should strive after. Once again, no book
is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have
nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude. – George
Orwell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One markdown file splits out into a few markdown files and use panda
to convert markdown files into htmls.</p>
<p>Because I have been writing code in Vim for years and I recently got
used to writing documentations in Vim, so writing these notes in Vim
feels easy and natural to me. I don’t need any mental transition to
write notes.</p>
