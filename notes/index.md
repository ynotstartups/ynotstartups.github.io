## Meaning Of Life

I believe that the meaning of life is to be alive.

I once thought the meaning of life is to enjoy every moment of life, but I
don't think it is true any more because there were good days and bad days so
it wasn't always possible to enjoy it.

But being alive (please do try your best) let you experience life in both its
beauty and the ugly. Life is your unique experience with the world and every
choices you made.

> The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and
> so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were
> necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.  ---- Alan Wilson Watts
