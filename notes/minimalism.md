# Minimalism

## How do I become a minimalist?

I become a minimalist after reading "The Life-Changing Magic of
Tidying" by Marie Kondo.

## On Processions

I own a small amount of things, more importantly, all of them are my
favourites. This leads to me being constantly happy and satisfied with my
living spaces.

Because of the small amount of things, I have a designated place for each
item, make my home easy to clean and to find things.

Some people shop to reduce stress, I don't have much desire to obtain more
things, so instead, I reduce stress to throwing things away.
