Coffee from this region is special because it is grown in an ideal microclimate, with relatively cold weather and rich, mountainous soils. When choosing lots we look for coffees like Tuberosa that will work specifically well when decaffeinated; coffee that can undergo the Sugarcane process and still retain incredible flavour clarity in each cup.</p> <p>This coffee is decaffeinated using our new and the all-natural Sugarcane process. This involves pressurising and expanding the coffee beans with light steam, before it's rinsed in Ethanol Acetate (EA), an organic compound created by the fermentation of non-GMO Colombian sugarcane. Mountain water and steam are then added to remove any remaining caffeine before the coffee is dried and delivered to the local quality control lab to grade quality.</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#barokah","title":"Barokah","text":"<p>The Barokah Cooperative sits at the foot of Mount Kerinci, the highest active volcano in Indonesia. This area is located in the Ring of Fire, a path of over 450 volcanoes that wraps around the Pacific Ocean which is highly unstable with frequent eruptions and plate movements. Despite the unique environment, the volcanic soil is extremely lush and fertile, making it the perfect terroir for growing outstanding coffee.</p> <p>The natural process requires the fewest number of steps at the washing station. Cherries are picked before being placed on patios to dry. They are then moved again onto raised beds which provides shade and better airflow. Typically, this process heightens the sweetness in the final cup.</p> <p>Expect pronounced strawberry and grapefruit notes that sit alongside a long caramel-like finish.</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#elvis","title":"Elvis","text":"<p>The 36 hour fermentation creates crisp raspberry acidity alongside citrus complexity.</p> <p>We started our journey in Peru two years ago with our local partner Falcon Specialty. Falcon only works with producers, who aren\u2019t members of a cooperative, association or organisation. These producers are the most vulnerable since they don\u2019t have access to training sessions or premiums for quality or certifications, and their income is totally dependent on the market price..</p> <p>This coffee is produced by Elvis Tineo Rafael, a second-generation coffee producer in El Diamante. We met him on our last trip and shared coffee and lunch together, to discuss his process.</p> <p>His coffee was washed and floated before being macerated in the cherry for 12 hours, which provides more sweetness to the coffee. The coffee was then dried under shade for 15 days. This process intensifies the acidity and transforms the final coffee to provide a crisp mouthfeel and sugary sweetness.</p> <p>FARM INFORMATION:</p> <p>Country: Peru Method: Extended Fermentation Producer: Elvis Tineo Rafael Region: Jaen, Cajamarca Varietal: Cataui Elevation: 1,730 masl Price to Producer: USD/LB: N/A</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#san-fermin","title":"San Fermin","text":"<p>San Fermin is what we call a \u2018session coffee', something you can drink all day long.</p> <p>San Fermin is a lot built from dozens of small producers in south Tolima. Etched out of the mountains, situated in some of the most remote locations each farm is only a few hectares. Farmers must cross rivers and trek through jungles before they can load dirt bikes and carts pulled by donkeys, to get the coffee to our partners at the local warehouse.</p> <p>The producers of San Fermin are a key part of who we are, and we have two ongoing projects that celebrate that relationship. Our yearly producer competition recognises these truly exceptional lots. Additionally, we have committed to purchasing a drier with our local partners, Caravela. This will save the producers having to return the coffee all the way back to their farms if it still needs some further drying, saving them extra time and effort.</p> <p>FARM INFORMATION</p> <p>Country: Colombia Method: Washed Producer: 27 Producers Region: Tolima Varietal: Caturra Elevation: 1,600 - 2,000 masl Price to Producer:  N/A</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#banka","title":"Banka","text":"<p>For cappuccino, the flavour is very balanced, it is not sour, not bitter, tastes perfect.</p> <p>Producer: Small-holder farmers from the villages of Banka Yi and Banka Er Processed at: Banka washing station managed by Yunnan Coffee Traders</p> <p>Region: Menglian Dai, Lahu and Va Autonomous County, Yunnan, China</p> <p>Altitude: 1350 masl</p> <p>Varietal: Catimor P3 &amp; P4 Hybrid cultivars Process: Natural, fermented in cherry for 2 days then dried inside of a solar dryer on raised beds for roughly 20 days</p> <p>Importer: Indochina Coffee</p> <p>Cup profile: Jammy &amp; thick body, dark cherries &amp; maple syrup</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#caballero-131","title":"CABALLERO #131","text":"<p>These beans have a very strong chili paste smell and flavour, it is too much for my taste.</p>"},{"location":"things-needed-for-travel/","title":"Things Needed For Travel","text":"<p>Toothbrush, toothpaste, slipper, clothes, tissue, Tepe toothbrush, floss, phone charger, contact lenses, make ups, hand cream, facial cream, hair band, hair clips, cotton butts, passport, BRP, book, lip balm, umbrella, converse bag, phone, wallet, keys, pen, paper, water bottle, hand sanitizer, earphone, hats, hair brush, universal socket adapter, camera, 35mm film, invisalign, invisalign cleaning capsule,</p>"},{"location":"things-needed-for-travel/#for-longer-trip","title":"For longer trip","text":"<p>shaver, shaving blade, shaving cream, coffee equipments, coffee beans, gloves, cotton gloves, no laptop, not too much clothes, one book only</p>"}]}
