# Minimalism

## How do I become a minimalist?

I become a minimalist after reading [The Life-Changing Magic of
Tidying](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-effective-clutter/dp/0091955106/ref=asc_df_0091955106/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310834580283&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11869604209145403320&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9041110&hvtargid=pla-492265979689&psc=1&th=1&psc=1)
and watching [Japanese tv series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5362450/) which
describes a more extreme form of minimalism...

## On Processions

I own a small amount of things, more importantly, all of them are my
favourites. This leads to me being constantly happy and satisfied with my
living spaces.

Because of the small amount of things, I have a designated place for each
item.  This is quite useful because it makes my home easy to clean and to find
things.

Some people shop to reduce stress, I don't have much desire to obtain more
things, so instead, I reduce stress to throwing things away.

Because I don't have the urge to buy things, I have a large proportion of my
salary leftover every month, then I learned about FIRE, see below.

## On household cleaning

It makes cleaning easier because

1. My living room is almost empty so mopping the floor is easy
1. When cleaning bathroom, I can first put away every things in the bathroom
surfaces.
