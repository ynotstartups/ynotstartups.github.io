My name is Tiger Yuhao Huang.

Welcome to my [digital garden](digital-garden.md)!

I am currently work as a python backend engineer at
[Saltus](https://www.saltus.co.uk/)!

I consider myself a [minimalist](minimalism.md).

My biggest passions are software engineering, [home cooking](cooking.md),
coffee brewing. Fun fact: I find dish washing meditating :)

I am also interested in
[reading](books.md),
[writing](digital-garden.md),
[eating out](restaurant-recommendations.md),
...

My wildest dream is to open a cafe called "Tou", it sells Man Tou (Chinese
steamed bun with no filling), black filter coffee, latte.

## Software Engineering Wisdom

### Behavioral

- Read documentation/manual/user’s guide before using a new tool/cli
  - this implies prefer using tool with good doc e.g. `fish` instead `bash`
- Be more curious about understanding how things work
- Prepare because I am bad at ac-hoc talk and thinking
  - ask for agenda for meetings so that I can be prepared
- Validate assumptions earlier

### Documentations

- Write comment first
  - Distinguish Interface documentation between Implementation documentation

### Design

- Design it twice
- Architect great design rather than just working codes, then writing comments
  should be fun since that’s how you identify the best design
- Check if the abstraction design reduce complexity?

## Meaning Of Life

I believe that the meaning of life is to be alive.

I once thought the meaning of life is to enjoy every moment of life, but I don't think it is true any more because there were good days and bad days so it wasn't always possible to enjoy it.

But being alive (please do try your best) let you experience life in both its beauty and the ugly. Life is your unique experience with the world and every choices you made.

Others also believe in this idea.

> The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.
