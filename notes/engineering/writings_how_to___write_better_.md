# write better

**Scrupulous writers, in every sentence that they write, will ask themselves at
least four questions:**

1. What am I trying to say?
1. What words will express it?
1. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
1. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?

**Two more that they may ask are:**

1. Could I put it more shortly?
1. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?

**Consequently there are ways to write well. The following rules will cover most
cases:**

1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
1. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
1. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
1. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
1. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
1. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
